#My CRUD-dy Favorites List

This app creates a list of your favorite items and displays from a MongoDB database.  A user
can create new items, fetch the list of items in the database, edit items and send a put request,
or delete items. This app was based on Brad Traversy's MERN shopping list project, which can be found at:

My app contains several key differences. Unlike Brad's project, my app supports editing db items. While his
uses Redux for state management, my app uses vanilla React's state management ability. My project also has tweaked
styling.

Thanks for reading.  Feel free to go to the app and add one of your favorite items, too! :)
